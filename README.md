#Credit Loan Default Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#Project Description
This project aims to analyze loan application data to identify key indicators that contribute to loan defaults. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we provide insights that help a consumer financing organization make informed decisions about loan approvals, thus minimizing financial risks. The project identifies significant features such as income, loan amount, and age that impact the likelihood of default.

#Techniques Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Processing: Data cleaning (handling missing values and outliers)
Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns in the dataset
Correlation Analysis: Determining relationships between features and loan default risk
Data Balancing: Techniques such as resampling to handle imbalanced datasets
#Key Features
Performed in-depth data cleaning and preparation, ensuring data quality by handling missing values and outliers.
Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them.
Identified key factors such as income, loan amount, and applicant age that significantly affect loan default risks.
Applied data balancing techniques to ensure model accuracy by addressing the imbalance in the target variable (loan default).
Provided actionable insights for lenders to adjust loan amounts and approval strategies to reduce default rates.
Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/credit-loan-default-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd credit-loan-default-analysis
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the project is set up, you can run the analysis by executing the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python credit_analysis.py
This will process the loan dataset and perform the exploratory data analysis, including data cleaning, correlation analysis, and result generation.

#Results
Key insights gained from the analysis:

#Income Level: Applicants with lower income and higher loan amounts are more likely to default.
Age: Younger applicants, especially those with larger loans, are at higher risk of default.
Loan Amount: Larger loans relative to the applicant's income increase the likelihood of default.
Recommendation: The organization should consider adjusting loan amounts based on income and applying stricter lending standards to younger applicants with high loan needs.
